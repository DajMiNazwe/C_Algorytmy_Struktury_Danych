A Diapered Six Year Old

Until recently I thought that I was the only one who liked wearing
diapers and plastic pants. I would love to find a mommy to care
for me and baby me. I have never been able to find anyone to share
this with or to treat me like a baby. I want a lady who will make me
wear diapers and plastic pants and will change me whenever I wet or
mess my diapers.I am 29 years old and am very nervous about writing
this case history but am doing it anyway.I have read letters on
how most adult babies were bed wetters and how their mothers put
them back into diapers because they said that if they wet like a baby
then they would have to wear diapers like a baby. Then they got so used
to wearing diapers that they needed them or just liked wearing them.
Sometimes even after they grew up their mothers would still make
them wear diapers and treat them like little babies because as
long as they were going to wet their beds like babies then mommy
was going to make sure they were still treated like a baby.
